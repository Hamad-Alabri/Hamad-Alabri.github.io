			This triple A title made by Rockstar Games and has sold over 155 million copies since its release on the 13th of September 2013, which is impressive as it is currently the 2nd most sold game in the world as of 2021 and believe me when I tell you it is well-deserved. This blockbuster-like video game has stunned the world with its massive and intuitive open world with lost of freedom given to the player to approach it however they like, GTA is a game like no other when it comes to restrictions as it has none.<br><br>
			The open world will also affect the part of the game that cannot be changed or edited later, it is also arguably the most important aspect of GTA since its not really a sandbox game even though it may seem like one, that aspect is the story line, and let me tell you, it is a masterpiece. You play as 3 characters; Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, that each have their own background story which make the player more attached to these characters as they all have a very important role in the main plot. Speaking of the main plot, Rockstar has not disappointed here, the game has all types of missions and gameplay. The story goes from being emotional to chaotic to thrilling and it just keeps getting better and better, it is very well written with precise animations done perfectly and graphics that look realistic even though this game was made 8 years ago. However, there were sometimes where I felt like some missions were a bit tedious because you just had to keep driving from one place to another while listening to unskippable dialogue which made the experience less than perfect.<br><br>
			Overall, if you can look past the boring dialogue, you will find a masterpiece that you can keep replaying and enjoying. I personally have played this game about 5 times and enjoyed every time even more than the last. <span style="color: #eeff00;">This game gets 4.5 stars.</span> <br><br>
