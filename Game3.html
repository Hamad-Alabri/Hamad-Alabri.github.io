			Activision has made a game that almost everybody knows whether you are a gamer or not, the franchise is so big that there has been a new call of duty released every year since 2003. Within the franchise, a certain series called “Black ops” made by Treyarch which is the one I will be reviewing. Black ops has a major role in the franchise and it is a fan favourite out of all the other call of duties because of how different and unique it is.<br><br>
			Black ops games usually have 3 modes which are campaign, multiplayer, and zombies. The PVE campaign experience has been consistently on par with the other call of duties, if not better, and has been able to impress the call of duty fan base every time, not only is it fun, but it is also well written and has high quality graphics and animations. The PVP multiplayer also offers the same quality as campaign but allowing players and friends to play with and against each other making it even more fun to pay than campaign. Zombies on the other hand is on another level, Treyarch were the ones to first introduce it to the Call of Duty franchise and no one has ever been able to compete with it as it offers one of the best PVE experiences you can ever have, it has never been more satisfying to eliminate a horde of zombies while trying to solve puzzles on the way with your friends.<br><br>
			Overall, the <span style="color: #eeff00;">Black Ops series gets a 4-star rating</span> because it is unparalleled with by any other game of its kind, however my only complaints are the skill based matchmaking that was introduced recently into multiplayer which ruins the PVP experience by a good chunk. Nonetheless it is still fun and does not disappoint as always. <br><br>
