			Originally created on the 17th of May 2009, it was a game that you could pay straight from a browser on your computer. Minecraft is an open world sandbox video game with the endless possibilities and the only limits being your own imagination, it had a strikingly popular beginnings as it spread through the word via word of mouth or social media with no advertisements nor any marketing prior, later, on the 18th of November 2011, Mojang Studios released the game again but this time as a proper application.<br><br>
			The game has rocketed with popularity ever since and has been considered by any people (including me) the best game that has ever been made, which is surprising considering its simplicity but that’s what makes Minecraft so sweet and fun. The world you pay in has no story because it is up to you to make one up, however, there is a way to beat the game, you must defeat a boss called “Ender Dragon” by completing many tasks and adventures without the game’s guidance or interference so you can do it however you like. This creates a sense of freedom and creativity like no other game, it makes you feel as if you are living in another dimension that has its own science and rules. <br><br>
			I have probably played over 4,000 hours of this game since I first started playing in 2011 and still do till this day and will never get bored of it because it has no restrictions, and I can do whatever I can dream of and there is aways something new to learn every day.<span style="color: #eeff00;"> This game gets 5 stars</span><br><br>
